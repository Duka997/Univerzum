	<h1>This article is about the Venus</h1>
<p>
Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates
 in the opposite direction to most other planets. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural
 object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of -4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never
 appears to venture far from the Sun; its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8 Celsius.
</p> 
<p>
Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.
 It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.
 The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth.

		<p>
		Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large volcanoes
		that are over 100 km across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii. This is not because Venus is more volcanically
		active than Earth, but because its crust is older. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an 
		average age of about 100 million years, whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300-600 million years old. 
	</p>

	<p>
	In 2008 and 2009, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by Venus Express, in the form of four transient localised infrared hot spots within 
	the rift zone Ganis Chasma, near the shield volcano Maat Mons. Three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit. These spots are thought
	to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions. The actual temperatures are not known, because the size of the hot spots could not be measured,
	but are likely have been in the 800-1100 K range, relative to a normal temperature of 740 K.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi2"> Internal structure </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
Without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus.
 The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth,
 the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.<br><br>
 The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets
 is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous.
 This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally
 generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing events.
	</p>

<div class="main">
	<h1> <a name = "drugi"> Magnetic field and magnetosphere</h1>
	<p>
	In 1967, Venera 4 found the Venusian magnetic field to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an interaction between
	the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo in the core like the one inside Earth. Venus's small induced magnetosphere
	provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation may result in cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges.<br><br>
	The lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at Venus was surprising given it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo
	at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive
	and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies the dynamo is
	missing because of a lack of convection in the Venusian core.

	<h1> <a name = "treci"> Orbit and rotation</h1>
	<p>
	Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 AU (108,000,000 km; 67,000,000 mi), and completes an orbit every 224.7 days.
	Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.
	When Venus lies between Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an average
	distance of 41 million km. <br><br> The planet reaches inferior conjunction every 584 days, on average. Because of the decreasing eccentricity
	of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches
	less than 40 million km; then there are none for about 60,158 years.

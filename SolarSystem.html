	<h1>This article is about the Sun and its planetary system</h1>
	<p>
	The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.
	Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets,[c] with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, 
	such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.

	</p> <br>
 
	<h1> <a name = "prvi">Discovery and exploration</a></h1>
		<p>
		For many thousands of years, humanity, with a few exceptions, did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle 
		Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through
		the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop
		a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. 
	</p>


	<p>
	In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics
	that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. 
	The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled 
	the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.
	</p>

<div class="main">
	<h1> <a name = "drugi"> Distances and scales </a> </h1>
	<p>
	The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit (150,000,000 km), or AU. For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km). Thus, the Sun occupies
	0.00001% (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10−6) that of the Sun. Jupiter,
	the largest planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000 km) from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune,
	is 30 AU (4.5x109 km) from the Sun.
	</p> <br><br>
 
	<h1> <a name = "treci"> Inner Solar System </a> </h1>
	<p>
	The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. Composed mainly of silicates and metals, the objects of the inner
	Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.
	This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.

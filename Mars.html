	<h1>This article is about the Mars</h1>
<p>
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often
 referred to as the "Red Planet" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet 
 with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
</p> 
<p>
The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of
 Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the
 Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons,
 Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
</p>

	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi1"> Internal structure </a> </b> </h3> </li>
		<p>
		Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials. Current models of its interior imply a core
		region about 1,794 (1,115) in radius, consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16-17% sulfur. This iron(II)
		sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in lighter elements than Earth's core. The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed
		many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but it now appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements
		in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 km (31 mi),
		with a maximum thickness of 125 km. <br>Earth's crust, averaging 40 km (25 mi), is only one third as thick as Mars', relative to the sizes
		of the two planets.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi2"> Surface geology </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
	Mars is a terrestrial planet that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock.
	The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar
	to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo show concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions
	displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts
	of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have also been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by
	finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> Soil </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
The Phoenix lander returned data showing Martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine.
 These nutrients are found in gardens on Earth, and they are necessary for growth of plants. Experiments performed by the lander showed that the
 Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> Hydrology </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
	Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is about 100 times thinner than Earth's, except at the lowest
	elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. The volume of water ice in the south polar
	ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11 meters . A permafrost mantle stretches from
	the pole to latitudes of about 60 C. Large quantities of water ice are thought to be trapped within the thick cryosphere of Mars. Radar data from
	Mars Express and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show large quantities of water ice both at the poles (July 2005) and at middle latitudes 
	(November 2008). The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008.
	</p>

<div class="main">
	<h1> <a name = "drugi"> Atmosphere </a> </h1>
	<p>
	Mars lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago, possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes, so the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian
	ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer. Both Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express have detected
	ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars, and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter.
	Compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied. Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges from a low of 30 Pa (0.030 kPa)
	on Olympus Mons to over 1,155 Pa (1.155 kPa) in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of 600 Pa (0.60 kPa).<br><br> The highest 
	atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found 35 km (22 mi) above Earth's surface. The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6% of
	that of Earth (101.3 kPa). The scale height of the atmosphere is about 10.8 km (6.7 mi),[142] which is higher than Earth's (6 km (3.7 mi))
	because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's, an effect offset by both the lower temperature and 50% higher average molecular
	weight of the atmosphere of Mars.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "drugi1"> Aurora </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
	n 1994 the European Space Agency's Mars Express found an ultraviolet glow coming from "magnetic umbrellas" in the southern hemisphere. 
	Mars does not have a global magnetic field which guides charged particles entering the atmosphere. Mars has multiple umbrella-shaped magnetic
	fields mainly in the southern hemisphere, which are remnants of a global field that decayed billions of years ago.
	</p>

	<h1> <a name = "treci"> Orbit and rotation </a> </h1>
	<p>
	Mars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million kilometres (143,000,000 mi), and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day
	(or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.[172] A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years,
	or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.
	</p>

	<p>
The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees relative to its orbital plane, which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth,
 though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. Currently, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close
 to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the 
 next perihelion came in January 2013.

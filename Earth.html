	<h1>This article is about the Earth</h1>
<p>
Earth (otherwise known as the world in Latin: Terra) is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the
 Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
</p> 
<p>
According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago. Earth gravitationally interacts
 with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times, creating
 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 Celsius away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing
 seasonal variations on the planet's surface with a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days). The Moon is Earth's only permanent natural satellite.
 Its gravitational interaction with Earth causes ocean tides, stabilizes the orientation of Earth's rotational axis, and gradually slows Earth's rotational rate.
</p>

<div class="main">
	<h1> <a name = "prvi"> Physical characteristics </a> </h1>
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi1"> Shape </a> </b> </h3> </li>
		<p>
		The shape of Earth approximates an oblate spheroid, a sphere flattened along the axis from pole to pole such that there is a bulge around the equator.
		 This bulge results from the rotation of Earth, and causes the diameter at the equator to be 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole
		diameter. Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador.
		The average diameter of the reference spheroid is about 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), because the meter was
		originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through Paris, France. 
	</p>

	<p>
	If Earth were shrunk to the size of a billiard ball, some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections,
	whereas much of the planet, including the Great Plains and the abyssal plains, would feel smoother.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi2"> Chemical composition </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
	Earth's mass is approximately 5.97x1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur 
	(2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass
	segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less 
	than 1% trace elements.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi3"> Internal structure </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties, but unlike 
the other terrestrial planets, it has a distinct outer and inner core. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain
 by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovicic discontinuity, and the thickness of the crust varies:
 averaging 6 km (kilometers) under the oceans and 30-50 km on the continents.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi4"> Tectonic plates </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
	The mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth, the lithosphere, is broken into pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move
	in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries,
	at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity,
	mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere,
	the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.
	</p>
</div>
 
<div class="main">
	<h1> <a name = "drugi"> Habitability </a> </h1>
	<p>
	A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex
	organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism.[190] The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its
	orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere and protective magnetic field all contribute to the
	current climatic conditions at the surface.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "drugi1"> Biosphere </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
	A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun evolving
	about 3.5 Gya. The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated
	primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at high 
	altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial
	latitudes.
	</p>

<div class="main">
	<h1>Orbit and rotation</h1>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "treci"> Rotation </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
	Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun-its mean solar day-is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar
	day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> Orbit </b> </h3> </li>
	<p>
Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million kilometres (93,000,000 mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year.
 This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1Celsius/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter 
 every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours-a solar day-for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun
 returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.8 km/s (107,000 km/h), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's
 diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.

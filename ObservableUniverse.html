	<h1>This article is about the Observable Universe</h1>
	<p>
	The observable universe consists of the galaxies and other matter that can, in principle, be observed from Earth at the present time because light and
	other signals from these objects have had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. Assuming the universe is isotropic,
	the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe is a spherical volume
	(a ball) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered
	on Earth.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The word observable used in this sense does not depend on whether modern technology actually permits detection of radiation from an object in this region
	(or indeed on whether there is any radiation to detect). It simply indicates that it is possible in principle for light or other signals from the object
	to reach an observer on Earth. In practice, we can see light only from as far back as the time of photon decoupling in the recombination epoch.
	That is when particles were first able to emit photons that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles. Before then, the Universe was filled
	with a plasma that was opaque to photons. The detection of gravitational waves indicates there is now a possibility of detecting non-light signals
	from before the recombination epoch.
	</p>

<div class="main">

	<h1> <a name = "prvi"> The Universe versus the observable universe</h1>
	<p> Some parts of the Universe are too far away for the light emitted since the Big Bang to have had enough time to reach Earth, so these portions of
	the Universe lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions
	will become observable. However, due to Hubble's law regions sufficiently distant from us are expanding away from us faster than the speed of light
	(special relativity prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other,
	but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see uses of the proper distance for a discussion) and
	furthermore the expansion rate appears to be accelerating due to dark energy. </p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi1"> Size </a> </b> </h3> </li>
		<p> 
		The comoving distance from Earth to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.26 gigaparsecs (46.5 billion light years or 4.40×1026 meters)
		in any direction. The observable universe is thus a sphere with a diameter of about 28.5 gigaparsecs (93 Gly or 8.8x1026 m). Assuming that space
		is roughly flat, this size corresponds to a comoving volume of about 1.22×104 Gpc3 (4.22x105 Gly3 or 3.57x1080 m3).
		</p>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<h1> <a name = "drugi"> Misconceptions on its size </a> </h1>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "drugi1"> 13.8 billion light-years </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	The age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or
	greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years.
	This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static Minkowski spacetime conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe,
	spacetime is curved in a way that corresponds to the expansion of space, as evidenced by Hubble's law. Distances obtained as the speed of light
	multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "drugi2"> 15.8 billion light-years </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
This is obtained in the same way as the 13.8 billion light year figure, but starting from an incorrect age of the universe that the popular press reported
 in mid-2006. For an analysis of this claim and the paper that prompted it, see the following reference at the end of this article.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "drugi3"> 78 billion light-years </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	In 2003, Cornish et al. found this lower bound for the diameter of the whole universe (not just the observable part), if we postulate that the
	universe is finite in size due to its having a nontrivial topology, with this lower bound based on the estimated current distance between
	points that we can see on opposite sides of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). If the whole universe is smaller than this sphere,
	then light has had time to circumnavigate it since the Big Bang, producing multiple images of distant points in the CMBR, which would show up
	as patterns of repeating circles.
	</p>
	
		
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "drugi4"> 180 billion light-years </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	This estimate combines the erroneous 156-billion-light-year figure with evidence that the M33 Galaxy is actually fifteen percent farther away than
	previous estimates and that, therefore, the Hubble constant is fifteen percent smaller. The 180-billion figure is obtained by adding 15% to 156
	billion light years.
	</p>

<div class="main">
		<h1> <a name = "treci"> Large-scale structure </a></h1>
	<p>
	Sky surveys and mappings of the various wavelength bands of electromagnetic radiation (in particular 21 cm emission) have yielded much information on 
	the content and character of the universe's structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a hierarchical model with organization up
	to the scale of superclusters and filaments. Larger than this (at scales between 30-200 megaparsecs), there seems to be no continued structure,
	a phenomenon that has been referred to as the End of Greatness.

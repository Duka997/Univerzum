	<li> The Milky Way began as a series of dense regions in the early universe not long after the Big Bang.
	The first stars to form were in globular clusters that still exist. They are among the oldest stars formed in the Milky Way region. </li> <br>
	<li> The Milky Way has grown by merging with other galaxies through time. It is currently acquiring stars from a very small galaxy 
	called the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal, as well as gobbling up material from the Magellanic Clouds. </li> <br>
	<li> The Milky Way moves through space at a velocity of about 552 kilometres per second (343 miles per second)
	with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. </li>
 
</div>
 
<div class="sideright">
 
	<li> The Milky Way’s central core contains a supermassive black hole. It is commonly referred to as Sagittarius A*. It contains the mass of about 4.3 million Suns. </li> <br>
	<li> The stars, gas and dust of the Milky Way all orbit the centre at a rate of about 220 kilometres per second. This constant rate for all stars at different distances 
	from the core implies the existence of a shell of dark matter surrounding our galaxy. </li> <br>
	<li> Our galaxy will collide with Andromeda Galaxy in about 5 billion years. Some astronomers refer to our two galaxy as a binary system of giant spirals. </li>

	<h1>This article is about the Milky Way Galaxy</h1>
	<p>
	The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. Its name "milky" is derived from its appearance as a dim glowing band arching across
	the night sky whose individual stars cannot be distinguished by the naked eye. The term "Milky Way" is a translation of the Latin via lactea. From Earth, the Milky Way
	appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo
	Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained
	all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that
	the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies - now estimated to number as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe.
	</p> <br>
	
	<p>
	Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotation speed contradicts 
	the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much of the mass of the Milky Way does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation. This mass has been given 
	the name "dark matter". The rotational period is about 240 million years at the position of the Sun. The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity 
	of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself 
	and thus likely formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.

	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi1"> Galactic quadrants </a> </b> </h3> </li>
		<p> 
		A galactic quadrant, or quadrant of the Milky Way, refers to one of four circular sectors in the division of the Milky Way. In actual astronomical practice,
		the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the galactic coordinate system, which places the Sun as the origin of the mapping system.<br>
		Quadrants are described using ordinals—for example, "1st galactic quadrant", "second galactic quadrant", or "third quadrant of the Milky Way".
		Viewing from the north galactic pole with 0 degrees (°) as the ray that runs starting from the Sun and through the Galactic Center, the quadrants are as follows:<br>

		1st galactic quadrant - 0 C  < longitude < 90 C <br>
		2nd galactic quadrant - 90 C < longitude < 180 C <br>
		3rd galactic quadrant - 180 C < longitude < 270 C <br>
		4th galactic quadrant - 270 C < longitude < 360 C <br>
	</p>

	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi2"> Galactic center </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	The Sun is 26,000 - 28,000 ly (8.0 - 8.6 kpc) from the Galactic Center. This value is estimated using geometric-based methods or by measuring selected astronomical objects
	that serve as standard candles, with different techniques yielding various values within this approximate range. In the inner few kpc (around 10,000
	light-years radius) is a dense concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called the bulge. It has been proposed that the Milky Way lacks a bulge
	formed due to a collision and merger between previous galaxies and that instead has a pseudobulge formed by its central bar.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi3"> Spiral arms </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	Outside the gravitational influence of the Galactic bars, astronomers generally organize the structure of the interstellar medium and stars in the disk of the Milky Way
	into four spiral arms. Spiral arms typically contain a higher density of interstellar gas and dust than the Galactic average as well as a greater concentration
	of star formation, as traced by H II regions and molecular clouds.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Milky Way's spiral structure is uncertain and there is currently no consensus on the nature of the Galaxy's spiral arms. Perfect logarithmic spiral patterns only
	crudely describe features near the Sun, because galaxies commonly have arms that branch, merge, twist unexpectedly, and feature a degree of irregularity.
	The possible scenario of the Sun within a spur / Local arm emphasizes that point and indicates that such features are probably not unique,
	and exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.
	</p>
	
		
	<li> <h3> <b> <a name = "prvi4"> Halo </a> </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	The Galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and globular clusters, of which 90% lie within 100,000 light-years (30 kpc) of the Galactic Center.
	However, a few globular clusters have been found farther, such as PAL 4 and AM1 at more than 200,000 light-years from the Galactic Center. About 40% of the Milky Way's
	clusters are on retrograde orbits, which means they move in the opposite direction from the Milky Way rotation. The globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about
	the Milky Way, in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a star.
	</p>
	
</div>
 
<div class="main">
		<h1> <a name = "drugi">Age and cosmological history </a></h1>
	<p>
	Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way, which thus set a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way. The ages of individual stars in the Milky Way
	can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long-lived radioactive elements such as thorium-232 and uranium-238, then comparing the results to estimates of their
	original abundance, a technique called nucleocosmochronology. These yield values of about 12.5 ± 3 billion years for CS 31082-001 and 13.8 ± 4 billion years for
	BD +17° 3248. Once a white dwarf is formed, it begins to undergo radiative cooling and the surface temperature steadily drops. By measuring the temperatures of
	the coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial temperature, an age estimate can be made. With this technique, the age of the globular
	cluster M4 was estimated as 12.7 ± 0.7 billion years. Age estimates of the oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of 12.6 billion years, and a 95% confidence 
	upper limit of 16 billion years.
	</p>
	<br><br>
 
	<h1> <a name = "treci"> Environment </a></h1>
	<p>
	The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are a binary system of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the Local Group, itself being
	part of the Virgo Supercluster. The Virgo Supercluster forms part of a greater structure, called Laniakea.

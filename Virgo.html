	<li> Paradoxically, it is the Sun's gravity that keeps the planets in orbit around it, just as the Earth's gravity keeps the Moon and satellites
	in orbit around it. The reason they do not just fall into the Sun is that they are travelling fast enough to continually "miss" it. </li> <br>
	<li> The reason the planets are travelling at just that speed which allows them to orbit the Sun (and not spiral into it or whirl away into space)
	is not a coincidence or evidence of divine intervention. </li> <br>
	<li> Because the Sun and planets all formed from the same spinning nebular cloud, this is also why they all rotate in the same direction. </li>

	<h1>This article is about the Virgo Supercluster</h1>
	<p>
	The Virgo Supercluster (Virgo SC) or the Local Supercluster (LSC or LS) is a mass concentration of galaxies that contains the Virgo Cluster in addition
	to the Local Group, which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy. At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter
	of 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). It is one of millions of superclusters in the observable universe.

	<h1>Virgo Supercluster</h1>
	<li> <h3> <b> Background </b> </h3> </li>
		<p> 
		Beginning with the first large sample of nebulae published by William and John Herschel in 1863, it was known that there is a marked excess of nebular
		fields in the constellation Virgo (near the north galactic pole). In the 1950s, French-American astronomer Gerard Henri de Vaucouleurs was the first
		to argue that this excess represented a large-scale galaxy-like structure, coining the term "Local Supergalaxy" in 1953 which he changed to "Local
		Supercluster" in 1958. (Harlow Shapley, in his 1959 book Of Stars and Men, suggested the term Metagalaxy.) Debate went on during the
		1960s and 1970s as to whether the Local Supercluster (LS) was actually a structure or a chance alignment of galaxies. The issue was resolved with
		the large redshift surveys of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which convincingly showed the flattened concentration of galaxies along the
		supergalactic plane.
	</p>

	<li> <h3> <b> Structure </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	In a comprehensive 1982 paper, R. Brent Tully presented the conclusions of his research concerning the basic structure of the LS. It consists of two
	components: an appreciably flattened disk containing two-thirds of the supercluster's luminous galaxies, and a roughly spherical halo containing the 
	remaining one-third. The disk itself is a thin ellipsoid with a long axis / short axis ratio of at least 6 to 1, and possibly as high as
	9 to 1. Data released in June 2003 from the 5-year Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dF) has allowed astronomers to compare the LS to
	other superclusters. The LS represents a typical poor (that is, lacking a high density core) supercluster of rather small size. It has one rich galaxy
	cluster in the center, surrounded by filaments of galaxies and poor groups. The Local Group is located on the outskirts of the LS in a small filament
	extending from the Fornax Cluster to the Virgo Cluster. The Virgo Supercluster's volume is very approximately 7000 times that of the Local Group
	or 100 billion times that of the Milky Way. See volumes of similar orders of magnitude.
	</p>
	
	<li> <h3> <b> Galaxy distribution </b> </h3> </li>
	
	<p>
	The number density of galaxies in the LS falls off with the square of the distance from its center near the Virgo Cluster, suggesting that 
	this cluster is not randomly located. Overall, the vast majority of the luminous galaxies (greater than absolute magnitude -13) are concentrated 
	in a small number of clouds (groups of galaxy clusters). Ninety-eight percent can be found in the following 11 clouds (given in decreasing order
	of number of luminous galaxies): Canes Venatici, Virgo Cluster, Virgo II (southern extension), Leo II, Virgo III, Crater (NGC 3672), Leo I, Leo 
	Minor (NGC 2841), Draco (NGC 5907), Antlia (NGC 2997) and NGC 5643. Of the luminous galaxies located in the disk, one third are in the Virgo Cluster, 
	while the remainder are found in the Canes Venatici Cloud and Virgo II Cloud, plus the somewhat insignificant NGC 5643 Group.
